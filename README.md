# Bernoulli-Naive-Bayes
A bare bones implementation of Bernoulli Naive Bayes. It uses the `fetch_20newsgroups` from `Scikit-Learn` as the dataset and achieves about ~70% accuracy the last time I checked. I'm sure further optimizations can be made.

### Dependencies:
  - Numpy
  - Scikit-Learn
  - Python 2.7

### To Run:
  - Get all the dependencies (pip or brew)
  - `python bayes.py`
